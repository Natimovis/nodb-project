                <h1>Different Diet Types</h1>
                <h2>The Paleolithic Diet</h2>
            <p>This popular diet, commonly referred to as paleo is based on the belief that a modern human should eat the way our
                evolutionary ancestors did. The name paleo originates from the Paleozoic Era. The term lithic refers to the stone age,
                A time when cavemen roamed the earth eating fruits, vegetables, and meat from the animals they hunted. The general idea 
                is that because these are the types of food that humans were eating while evolving into what we are now, this
                must mean that any other type of food is bad for you. After all, humans have 
                "only" been consuming grain based products with gluten for 20,000 years. Therefore paleo enthusiasts claim that you are 
                much more likely to have a gluten intolerance then has been scientifically published. The truth is that at most 6% of 
                people are gluten intollerant however those numbers are most likely exaggerated. 
                The big things to avoid on paleo are grains,
                legumes, nuts, beans, dairy products, sugar, and artificial sweeteners. These are all foods that have a
                higher carbohydrate and calorie count then fruits, veggies, and meat. 
                People do lose weight with paleo, however it's not because the human body in incompatable with any food
                introduced in the neolithic erra and beyond. It's because their caloric intake then drops far enough below their caloric
                threshold for weight loss to occur. There is a small percentage of people who the paleo diet would actually make a lot of
                sense for. Less then 1% of people have celiac disease and are legitimately allergic to gluten. For all others there 
                are alternative methods that are much healthier and produce better results. Paleo is just one interesting example, 
                however there are many other fad diets that have come and gone with very similar rules and restrictions. 
                One such diet is called the ketogenic diet. </p>
                <h2>The ketogenic Diet</h2>
                <p> Keto is currently the most popular diet. So if you are currently on this or know someone who is make sure to
                    read this full section so you can understand the safest way to go about this particular diet. The main
                    difference between keto and paleo is that with keto the focus 
                    is on putting your body into a state of ketosis. Ketosis is carbohydrate deprivation. The truth is that any
                    kind of serious macro nutrient deprivation is going to be detrimental to your health. Carb deprivation causes
                    ketonemia, or ketone bodies in the blood. Ketone bodies are then used to fuel the brain and muscles instead of
                    glycogen. Unfortunately ketone bodies are not nearly as efficient in fueling activity as glycogen.
                    Glycogen is what would normally fuel your muscles and brain, but glycogen is made using carbs which
                    your body will not have in a state of ketosis. In a prolonged state of ketosis, you will feel sluggish, your 
                    mental processes will suffer, and your body will gradually become dehydrated. Many people have found they
                    lose more weight with keto then any other diet they've tried. This is because they are losing muscle, water,
                    and fat at the same time. When the body runs out of carbs it will deplete all glycogen in the muscles
                    which will cause a person to feel as though their muscles are smaller and weaker then normal, this is because
                    they are, muscles need glycogen to be strong and will decrease in size as glycogen depletes. However that is 
                    only the beginning. Once glycogen is completely used up from the muscle line, the body will then burn the 
                    majority of available protein for energy. Because a persons body does not have adequate protein in ketosis
                    they will have substantial muscle loss further contributing to the "miracle weight loss strategy." Another reason
                    so many have seen results so fast is because muscle weighs more then fat so loss of muscle takes more weight
                    off. After depleting the majority of available protein the body will then finally
                    begin to burn fats for ketones. It is at this point the body is in a state of ketosis. 
                    Unfortunately though the primary directive of the diet is to burn fat, the fat will be burned incompletely
                    as the body requires adequate amounts carbohydrates to break down and metabolize fat. With keto
                    you have a very high consumption of fats.
                    The problem with fat is that it remains in the body clogging the arteries and adding to the risk of heart disease.
                    Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the Unites States today. There is substantial scientific evidence
                    that most heart problems stem from excessive saturated fat consumption. The disproportanately high fat content
                    in most American diets is not helping either. 
                    Diets high in saturated fat also tend to raise the cholesterol levels of the blood. The order of fat
                    from least to most healthy goes transfat, saturated fat, unsaturated fat, and then polyunsaturated fat. 
                    Health experts recommend that 2/3rds of a persons necessary fat consumption come from polyunsaturated fat 
                    This ratio would be virtually impossible on a ketogenic diet.
