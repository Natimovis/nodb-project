                <h1>Different Diet Types</h1>
                <h2>The Paleolithic Diet</h2>
            <p>This popular diet, commonly referred to as paleo is based on the belief that a modern human should eat the way our
                evolutionary ancestors did. The name paleo originates from the Paleozoic Era. The term lithic refers to the stone age,
                A time when cavemen roamed the earth eating fruits, vegetables, and meat from the animals they hunted. The general idea 
                is that because these are the types of food that humans were eating while evolving into what we are now, this
                must mean that any other type of food is bad for you. After all, humans have 
                "only" been consuming grain based products with gluten for 20,000 years. Therefore paleo enthusiasts claim that you are 
                much more likely to have a gluten intolerance then has been scientifically published. The truth is that at most 6% of 
                people are gluten intollerant however those numbers are most likely exaggerated. 
                The big things to avoid on paleo are grains,
                legumes, nuts, beans, dairy products, sugar, and artificial sweeteners. These are all foods that have a
                higher carbohydrate and calorie count then fruits, veggies, and meat. 
                People do lose weight with paleo, however it's not because the human body in incompatable with any food
                introduced in the neolithic erra and beyond. It's because their caloric intake then drops far enough below their caloric
                threshold for weight loss to occur. There is a small percentage of people who the paleo diet would actually make a lot of
                sense for. Less then 1% of people have celiac disease and are legitimately allergic to gluten. For all others there 
                are alternative methods that are much healthier and produce better results. Paleo is just one interesting example, 
                however there are many other fad diets that have come and gone with very similar rules and restrictions. 
                One such diet is called the ketogenic diet. </p>
                <h2>The ketogenic Diet</h2>
                <p> Keto is currently the most popular diet. So if you are currently on this or know someone who is make sure to
                    read this full section so you can understand the safest way to go about this particular diet. The main
                    difference between keto and paleo is that with keto the focus 
                    is on putting your body into a state of ketosis. Ketosis is carbohydrate deprivation. The truth is that any
                    kind of serious macro nutrient deprivation is going to be detrimental to your health. Carb deprivation causes
                    ketonemia, or ketone bodies in the blood. Ketone bodies are then used to fuel the brain and muscles instead of
                    glycogen. Unfortunately ketone bodies are not nearly as efficient in fueling activity as glycogen.
                    Glycogen is what would normally fuel your muscles and brain, but glycogen is made using carbs which
                    your body will not have in a state of ketosis. In a prolonged state of ketosis, you will feel sluggish, your 
                    mental processes will suffer, and your body will gradually become dehydrated. Many people have found they
                    lose more weight with keto then any other diet they've tried. This is because they are losing muscle, water,
                    and fat at the same time. When the body runs out of carbs it will deplete all glycogen in the muscles
                    which will cause a person to feel as though their muscles are smaller and weaker then normal, this is because
                    they are, muscles need glycogen to be strong and will decrease in size as glycogen depletes. However that is 
                    only the beginning. Once glycogen is completely used up from the muscle line, the body will then burn the 
                    majority of available protein for energy. Because a persons body does not have adequate protein in ketosis
                    they will have substantial muscle loss further contributing to the "miracle weight loss strategy." Another reason
                    so many have seen results so fast is because muscle weighs more then fat so loss of muscle takes more weight
                    off. After depleting the majority of available protein the body will then finally
                    begin to burn fats for ketones. It is at this point the body is in a state of ketosis. 
                    Unfortunately though the primary directive of the diet is to burn fat, the fat will be burned incompletely
                    as the body requires adequate amounts carbohydrates to break down and metabolize fat. With keto
                    you have a very high consumption of fats.
                    The problem with fat is that it remains in the body clogging the arteries and adding to the risk of heart disease.
                    Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the Unites States today. There is substantial scientific evidence
                    that most heart problems stem from excessive saturated fat consumption. The disproportanately high fat content
                    in most American diets is not helping either. 
                    Diets high in saturated fat also tend to raise the cholesterol levels of the blood. The order of fat
                    from least to most healthy goes transfat, saturated fat, unsaturated fat, and then polyunsaturated fat. 
                    Health experts recommend that 2/3rds of a persons necessary fat consumption come from polyunsaturated fat 
                    This ratio would be virtually impossible on a ketogenic diet. With all that being said this is the correct
                    way to go about the keto diet if one makes the decision to still try this particular diet. Though doctors
                    say the keto diet should be avoided there are a lot of 
                    bodybuilders who like the ketosis diet anyway. When you are limiting your carb intake, you can test for ketosis by 
                    purchasing ketostix at pretty much any pharmacy. As long as the test strips show no indication of ketosis you are
                    not depriving yourself of carbohydrates. As soon as you see any color change you will know that your body is 
                    lacking glycogen and you need to increase your carb intake. Bottom line. Cut down your carbs as much as you can,
                    so long as the ketostix do not change color, when they do, increase your carbohydrate intake.

                <h2>Well what about fasting?</h2>
                <p>Let's just get straight to the point on this one. Yes fasting is a surefire way to lose weight. It should also be noted
                    that 60% of that weight loss is muscle loss.
                </p>
                <h2>The Doctor Recommended Diet</h2>
                <p>So now we know what doesn't work, but that begs the question, what does work? The answer is not in what you eat as much as it is
                    how much of it you eat. The bottom line is that if you eat less then your "caloric threshold" you will lose weight, if you eat
                    more then your "caloric threshold" you will gain weight. In fact there was a nutrition professor at kansas state University who
                    lost 27 lbs on a 2 month long snack food diet that put twinkies at the forefront just to prove this point. So how does one 
                    know what their caloric threshold is and how much above
                    or below it they should be at for their goals? Simple use this website! On the next page can enter some basic
                    information about yourself and you will be given a personalized recommendation that accounts for all of the things you should consider
                    before deciding on what and how you should eat.
                    

                <h2>Some basic information you may want to know before reading your recommendation</h2>
                <p>Everything that you will eat, or even drink is considered to be a calorie. Calories can be divided into three subgroups, carbohydrates
                    proteins, and fats. Every other food type you will hear about is a subcategory these three. For example sugar is simply a
                    carbohydrate that has a high glycemic index. Everything is good in proper proportion except for trans fats. So how do we know what 
                    the proper proportions are? Simple, tell us a little bit about yourself and we will tell you everything you need to know to reach your goals,
                    based on your weight, height, how often you exercise, and some other key factors.
